                <p id="20250615054852-ezdui1w">SyMark was created because I (the author) was struggling to write due to complicated build processes with Markdown based static site generators. Thus, the goal of SyMark is to have as little friction between writing and publishing as possible, with a WYSIWYG publishing experience that no Markdown based tools can achieve.</p>
<p id="20250615055210-b8xznsa">The specific goals are:</p>
<ul id="20250615055043-exc5iw0">
<li id="20250615055044-o3hxue8"><p id="20250615055044-0j0m0np"><strong>Frictionless</strong> - Be as frictionless as possible. What you see in SiYuan is what you get on the web with all fonts, page layouts, and other elements intact. The &quot;just works&quot; nature of SaaS, but with public domain code.</p>
</li>
<li id="20250615055222-6qi3xhw"><p id="20250615055222-3s4d5e4"><strong>Longevity</strong> - Be as easily and cheaply maintainable as possible. No one wants to build on ground destined to erode in a decade. This means being <em>simple software</em> without flashy gimmicks.</p>
</li>
<li id="20250615055549-80yp3i9"><p id="20250615055549-guhmp6r"><strong>Public Domain</strong> - Be inviting to new contributors and pro-freedom. This is <em>your</em> software, this is <em>my</em> software, this is <strong>our</strong> software. No one owns the code, it&#39;s a public good, free for any and all to enjoy.</p>
</li>
<li id="20250615060352-h6z7hrq"><p id="20250615060352-4premqd"><strong>Privacy</strong> - Be free of telemetry, trackers, and creepy anti-user things. Respecting users means they&#39;ll respect the project, don&#39;t take advantage of them.</p>
</li>
<li id="20250615060542-margjhl"><p id="20250615060542-g642s4s"><strong>Nonjudgemental</strong> - Be open to any use cases and innovations by users. It&#39;s not a brand, its a piece of software, no restrictions on usage and no worries about lawsuits for &quot;unapproved use&quot;. Just don&#39;t use the SyMark name if you fork the codebase.</p>
</li>
<li id="20250615055923-d6b33yk"><p id="20250615055923-y1gy8gm"><strong>Subtle improvements</strong> - Be open to improving over time. Take measurable steps towards a better user experience, specification adherance, and other things in the users&#39; best interest, but don&#39;t rush it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
