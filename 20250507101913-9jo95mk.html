<p>Most software nowadays is built to be fragile; requiring a constant internet connection, licensing servers, and/or other things that can screw up your workflow when they break. This method of buliding software removes agency from the creator and gives control to the company or individual who created the software.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about whether your content will last and your website will always be updatable, you&#39;re stuck worrying if their payment infrastructure will ever go down, or screwing around with self-hosting a shim licensing server to get the now-defunct product which you paid for working again.</p>
<p>More often than not, licensing servers, telemetry, and other anti-user mechanisms of extracting value from users end up being used beyond thier original purpose; turning into dystopian tools designed to keep specific groups away from software (part of export controls).</p>
